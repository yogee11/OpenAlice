# Contributors

OpenAlice is shaped by the people who dig into it with us — and this page is the
record of who they are and what each one moved. The project stays open; if your
work left a mark on it, you belong here.

## How recognition works

- If your **report, idea, design, or review** shaped a change, you're credited
  here — with a link to the actual change you influenced. A real record, not
  just a name on a wall.
- **Credit types:**
  🤔 ideas · 🎨 design · 🐛 bug report · 👀 review · 💬 question answered ·
  📖 docs · 🛡️ security · 🌍 translation · 💻 code _(rare — reimplemented with
  your consent)_
- **How to earn one:** open an
  [issue](https://github.com/TraderAlice/OpenAlice/issues) or PR with an idea,
  report, design, or implementation proposal. If it lands in the project, we add
  you. Think we missed crediting you? Say so in an issue or on Discord — we'll
  fix it.
- **Standouts (⭐):** a few people go notably above and beyond — high-signal,
  consistent, often right. They sit at the top.

## The roll

<!--
  Maintainer note — adding someone:
    • Put standouts (⭐) first; everyone else below, newest-ish at the bottom.
    • The avatar comes free from  https://github.com/<handle>.png  — no token.
    • Link each "Shaped" item to the PR / commit / issue it influenced.
    • Pick credit emoji from the list above; honesty over generosity isn't the
      goal here — credit them for what they actually moved.
