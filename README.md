## What is OpenAlice?

OpenAlice is a local trading workspace for coding agents.

The core idea is simple: coding agents became useful quickly because software work already has a collaboration substrate. Code has git, issues, markdown docs, review workflows, linters, terminals, logs, and reproducible project folders. A coding agent can enter that world and immediately understand how to inspect, modify, review, and report work.

Trading usually does not have that shape. A trader may read news, browse charts, hold broker positions, and keep private notes, but the work is rarely organized as a collaborative system that a human and multiple AI agents can share.

OpenAlice tries to make trading agent-operable by mapping trading work onto the tools coding agents already understand:

- **Workspaces** - each serious task gets a directory, git repo, terminal session, and native agent CLI.
- **Issues** - trading work becomes self-describing markdown tasks, similar to Linear tickets.
- **Tracked entities** - assets, sectors, topics, theses, and people become an Obsidian-like memory graph.
- **Inbox** - finished work is delivered as durable reports instead of disappearing into chat history.
- **Market tools** - data, news, fundamentals, technical analysis, and trading account state are exposed through CLIs and local tools.
- **Trading as Git** - optional account actions are staged, committed, reviewed, and pushed through an approval gate.

OpenAlice does not replace Claude Code, Codex, opencode, Pi, or other coding agents. It gives them a trading-shaped place to work.

## The Core Loop

Start with read-only research. You do not need a broker account to get value from OpenAlice.

1. **Ask Alice** for a market question, company overview, sector scan, or thesis check.
2. **Track what should persist** as entities and `[[wikilinks]]`.
3. **Create an issue** when the work should continue, recur, or be handed to an agent later.
4. **Schedule the issue** by writing timing and instructions into the same markdown file.
5. **Read the result in Inbox** when the agent has something worth showing you.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="docs/images/issue-board.jpg" alt="OpenAlice Issue Board"></td>
    <td><img src="docs/images/tracked.jpg" alt="OpenAlice Tracked Entities"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>Issue Board</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>Tracked Entities</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="docs/images/inbox.jpg" alt="OpenAlice Inbox"></td>
    <td><img src="docs/images/market.jpg" alt="OpenAlice Market tools"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>Inbox</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>Market Tools</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

That loop is the main product surface today. A timer does not call a magic trading endpoint. It launches an agent against a self-describing workspace issue, using the same files, tools, memory, and reporting path an attended session uses.

## What You Get

| Surface | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Workspaces** | Per-task git repositories with a persistent terminal running `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, or `shell`. |
| **Issue Board** | Markdown-backed work items with status, priority, assignee, comments, links, and optional schedule metadata. |
| **Tracked Entities** | A durable graph for tickers, themes, sectors, people, risks, and theses. |
| **Inbox** | A delivery surface for reports, scheduled run output, and agent status updates. |
| **Market Data** | Equities, crypto, macro, fundamentals, symbol search, technical indicators, news, and RSS tools. |
| **Unified Trading Account** | Optional beta account abstraction for brokers such as Alpaca, IBKR, Longbridge, and CCXT venues. |
| **Trading as Git** | Stage, commit, review, and push account operations instead of letting an agent fire orders directly. |

## Why Local?

Trading involves private notes, account state, credentials, strategy, and real money. OpenAlice runs on your machine by default, stores state as files under `~/.openalice`, and keeps broker credentials sealed at rest.

There is no Postgres or Redis to provision. Config, sessions, issues, inbox entries, workspace artifacts, news archives, and trading history are ordinary files and git repositories. That makes the system easier to inspect, back up, debug, patch, and reason about.

## Quick Start

Pick the run path that matches your machine:

- **macOS** - use the signed Apple Silicon desktop build: [macOS install](https://openalice.ai/docs/getting-started/install-macos).
- **Windows** - run from source today: [Windows install](https://openalice.ai/docs/getting-started/install-windows).
- **Linux, Intel Mac, contributors, debugging** - use the source path: [Source & Dev](https://openalice.ai/docs/getting-started/developer-setup).
- **Server or always-on machine** - use Docker Compose: [Docker deployment](https://openalice.ai/docs/deployment/docker).

The source path is still the best early-adopter path because it gives you logs and local code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TraderAlice/OpenAlice.git
cd OpenAlice
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the UI URL printed by the terminal, usually `http://localhost:5173`.

The packaged desktop includes a managed Pi runtime. Source and Docker installs
need at least one agent CLI installed and logged in, such as `claude`, `codex`,
`opencode`, or `pi`. OpenAlice runs the model loop inside that native CLI so you
keep its prompt cache, terminal rendering, provider login, and tool behavior.

## Project Status

OpenAlice is useful today for research, issue-based work, tracked memory, scheduled reports, and Inbox delivery.

Treat broker execution as beta infrastructure. Start with simulator, paper, demo, or testnet accounts. If you hit UTA errors, broker connection failures, or confusing execution behavior, bring the error to Discord or open a GitHub issue so we can reproduce it.

## Getting Help

Stuck? The fastest path is usually:

1. **Ask an AI coding agent to inspect the repo** - OpenAlice is intentionally file-backed and agent-readable.
2. **Read the docs** - [openalice.ai/docs](https://openalice.ai/docs).
3. **Ask DeepWiki** - [deepwiki.com/TraderAlice/OpenAlice](https://deepwiki.com/TraderAlice/OpenAlice).
4. **Join the community** - [Discord](https://discord.gg/zf4STmrQd8) for English speakers, [QQ group](https://qm.qq.com/q/iSg6O4FmrC) for 中文开发者.
