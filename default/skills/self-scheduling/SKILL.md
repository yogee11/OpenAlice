description: >
  Track and self-schedule work for THIS workspace by writing one markdown file
  per issue under `.alice/issues/<id>.md` at the workspace root. Each file is
  YAML frontmatter + one canonical markdown What. An issue WITHOUT a `when` field is
  just a tracked work item (it shows on the Issue board, the scanner ignores
  it). An issue WITH a `when` field self-schedules: the launcher scans the dir
  and, when it's due, dispatches the Workspace or assigned product Session with
  your prompt; the run reports back to the user's Inbox. Use for: "track this",
  "add an issue/todo", "run this every 30 minutes", "every morning before the
  open do X", "check Y each hour and ping me only if Z", "do this once at 4pm",
  "self-schedule", "set up a recurring job". Manage issues either by editing
  the files directly or with the `alice-workspace issue …` CLI (list / show /
  create / update / comment); the same tools are also exposed over MCP (one
  adapter).

# Issues & self-scheduling — `.alice/issues/<id>.md`

OpenAlice treats an issue as a collaboration object, not just a timer. It is the
durable place to put trading follow-up, monitoring work, open questions,
handoffs, and scheduled checks. Status, priority, and assignee tell humans and
agents what deserves attention; `when` is the extra field that lets an issue
summon a headless agent run.

This workspace owns its work as **one markdown file per issue** in `.alice/issues/`
at its own root. Each file is YAML frontmatter (the structured fields) plus a
markdown What (the human-visible work definition and exact scheduled prompt).

- An issue **without** `when` is a plain **tracked work item** — it appears on
  the Issue board for you and the user to see, but the scanner never fires it.
- An issue **with** `when` **self-schedules**: a launcher scanner reads the dir
  (it never interprets the work) and fires a **headless run** of this workspace
  when the issue is due — exactly like a recurring job.

The filename stem **is** the issue id (`morning-scan.md` → id `morning-scan`).

## Two ways to manage issues — the CLI (agent surface) or the file

You have two equivalent paths, and both write the **same**
`.alice/issues/<id>.md` files:

1. **`alice-workspace issue …` — the convenient agent surface, and what you
   should reach for first.** A small set of verbs does the read-modify-write for
   you: id slug derivation, frontmatter validation against the allowed
   status/priority enums, structured comment sidecars, and not clobbering an
   existing id. The same tools are also exposed over **MCP** — it is *one*
   registration behind both, so an MCP-speaking agent gets the identical surface
   with no separate path.
2. **Editing the file directly** with your normal file tools. Reach for this when
   you are writing rich markdown **What** or scheduling frontmatter
   (`when` / `assignee` / `agent`) — the CLI verbs cover the board fields, What, and
   comments, but the document and schedule shape read most clearly as text. The
   file is always the single source of truth either way.

### CLI verbs

```bash
# list — scan the WHOLE board: every workspace's issues as compact title rows
alice-workspace issue list

# show — one issue in full, resolved by its (global) name: frontmatter + What + comments +
# run history + inbox reports. --id takes a name OR id and resolves across the
# board; a name two workspaces share returns the candidates to pick from.
alice-workspace issue show --id morning-scan

# create — a new issue. --title is required; --id is derived as a kebab slug
# from the title when omitted. Creating over an existing id is refused.
alice-workspace issue create --title "Split the data fetcher" \
  --priority medium \
  --what "src/fetch.ts mixes the HTTP call with the normalization step."

# update — patch board fields or canonical What; scheduling frontmatter is left
# untouched. Setting status done|canceled is how
# you silence a self-scheduled issue (there is no separate enabled flag).
alice-workspace issue update --id morning-scan --status done

# comment — append markdown to the structured `<id>.comments.json` sidecar, authored as
# ws:<this workspace>. Use it for a progress note, finding, or a question.
alice-workspace issue comment --id morning-scan --text "Brief pushed; SPY gapped +0.4%."
```

Run `alice-workspace issue <verb> --help` for a verb's flags. Object-valued flags
take JSON — e.g. to create a self-scheduled issue in one call, pass the schedule
as `--when`:

```bash
alice-workspace issue create --title "Pre-market brief" --priority high \
  --when '{"kind":"cron","cron":"30 8 * * 1-5"}' \
  --assignee session:self \
  --what "Pull pre-market movers and overnight news for my watchlist, write a short brief to research/premarket.md, then run: alice-workspace inbox push --doc research/premarket.md --comments 'Pre-market brief'." \
  --agent claude
```

The verb set is `list` / `show` / `create` / `update` / `comment` (no `delete` —
remove an issue by deleting its file, see Notes). **Reads are global, writes are
local:** `list` and `show` read the whole board across **every** workspace —
scan titles with `list`, decide which matter, then `show --id <name>` to read those
in full (the natural way to work a board) — while `create` / `update` /
`comment` write **this** workspace's own `.alice/issues/` files (changing a
peer's board is the human-approved peer-edit path). The examples below show the
on-disk file shape the CLI and your direct edits both produce.

## Example — a scheduled issue (`.alice/issues/morning-scan.md`)

```markdown
---
title: Pre-market brief
status: todo
priority: high
assignee: session:resume-calm-amber-river-a1b2c3
when: { kind: cron, cron: "30 8 * * 1-5" }
---

Pull pre-market movers and overnight news for my watchlist. Every trading
morning at 08:30, assemble the pre-market picture before the open, write a short
brief to `research/premarket.md`, then push it to Inbox. Cover movers, gaps, and
overnight headlines that move the thesis.
```

## Example — an unscheduled work item (`.alice/issues/refactor-fetcher.md`)

```markdown
---
title: Split the data fetcher into source + transform
status: backlog
priority: medium
assignee: unassigned
---

`src/fetch.ts` mixes the HTTP call with the normalization step, which makes the
retry logic hard to test. Pull the transform into its own pure function so it
can be unit-tested without the network. No rush — picking this up next time we
touch fetching.
```

The first self-schedules (it has `when`) and keeps one accountable product
Session; the second is a pure work item the scanner ignores. Drop the `when`
line and any issue becomes a
plain tracked item; add a `when` and it starts firing.

## Frontmatter fields

- **`title`** — short, human-readable title of the issue (e.g. `Pre-market
  brief`). **Required.** This is what the Issue board and Inbox show. (The
  stable machine key is the filename `id`, not the title — so you can reword a
  title freely.)
- **`status`** *(optional, default `todo`)* — one of `backlog`, `todo`,
  `in_progress`, `done`, `canceled`. For a **scheduled** issue this is also its
  on/off switch: it fires only while the status is non-terminal. Moving it to
  `done` or `canceled` **silences** the schedule without deleting the file.
  (There is no `enabled` field — terminal status is how you pause a timer.)
- **`priority`** *(optional, default `none`)* — `urgent`, `high`, `medium`,
  `low`, `none`. Display/sort only.
- **`assignee`** *(optional, default `workspace`)* — the single owner and
  scheduled-dispatch policy:
  - `workspace` recruits a new product Session for each scheduled fire;
  - `session:<resumeId>` continues that exact accountable Session;
  - `human` and `unassigned` are valid only for unscheduled work.
  The CLI convenience value `session:self` resolves to the caller's concrete
  `session:<resumeId>` before writing the file.
- **`when`** *(OPTIONAL — present iff the issue self-schedules)* — one of:
  - `{ kind: every, every: "30m" }` — repeat on an interval (`30m`, `2h`,
    `1h30m`). Runs on the next scan, then on the interval.
  - `{ kind: cron, cron: "0 9 * * 1-5" }` — a 5-field cron expression
    (`min hour day-of-month month day-of-week`; supports `*`, ranges `9-17`,
    lists `1,15`, steps `*/15`). Wall-clock; waits for the next match.
  - `{ kind: at, at: "2026-03-01T13:30:00Z" }` — run ONCE at an ISO timestamp,
    then never again.
- **`agent`** *(optional)* — runtime override for `workspace`-owned scheduled
  work; defaults to this Workspace's runtime resolution. A Session assignee
  already has an immutable runtime, so Session-owned Issues cannot set this.

The old parallel `execution` field is retired and rejected after migration;
never write it into a new Issue.

The markdown **What** below the closing `---` is the Issue's canonical work
definition. It is useful for every Issue; when scheduled, this exact visible
markdown becomes the headless prompt. Comments are separate structured markdown
records in `.alice/issues/<id>.comments.json`, written through `issue comment`.

## Link entities and issues with `[[name]]`

An Issue's What can reference things in the `[[]]` knowledge graph, exactly like
any other note: write `[[name]]` to link a **tracked entity** (an asset ticker
or topic, e.g. `[[vst]]`, `[[ai-data-center-power]]`) or **another issue** (by
its id or title). The link shows up as a backlink on the target's page and is
clickable in the issue detail — so an issue saying "blocked on
`[[refactor-fetcher]]` until `[[vst]]` earnings clear" wires straight to both.

Names are **global** and team-wide, not workspace-scoped — `[[vst]]` means the
same thing everywhere, and there is no workspace prefix. Because of that, a
**vague or short issue title can collide** with an issue of the same name in
another workspace; nothing blocks you at write time, but the board flags such
clashes with a duplicate-name warning in the UI **for you to clean up
manually** (rename one, or merge them). So give an issue a **specific,
self-describing title** (prefer `Split the data fetcher into source + transform`
over `cleanup`) — it makes the issue a clean, unambiguous `[[ ]]` target and
avoids the collision flag in the first place.

## Write `what` for a headless run

The scheduled run is **headless — nobody is watching, and it cannot see this
conversation.** Write What as a
**complete, standalone instruction**, as if handing the job to a fresh teammate
who has only this workspace's files. Say exactly what to read, do, and produce.

**Decide what it outputs — and decide on purpose.** A headless run that does real
work and surfaces nothing has vanished. So:

- If the run produces something the user should see — a brief, a finding, a
  result — **push it to the Inbox**, the only channel a headless run has:
  `alice-workspace inbox push --comments "…"` (attach files with repeatable
  `--doc <path>`; run `alice-workspace --help` for the flags). A report pushed
  during a scheduled run is automatically linked back to the issue that
  triggered it — you don't pass any id.
- If the run is a **check that didn't trigger** (condition not met, nothing
  changed), **exit silently — that is the correct outcome**, not a failure.
  Don't manufacture noise.

Put **conditions inside `what`**, not in the schedule — there is no condition
field. For "ping me only if X", write: "check X; if it holds, push an alert;
otherwise do nothing and exit."

> **Commit the file.** The scanner reads your working tree, so an uncommitted
> `.alice/issues/<id>.md` still takes effect — but commit it so the issue (and
> any schedule) travels with the workspace and survives. Treat it like any
> other source file.

> **Trades still need a human.** A scheduled run can research, prepare, and even
> *stage* trades — but staged trades execute only when you approve them in the
> Web UI (Trading-as-Git). A timer never moves money on its own.

## Notes

- The scanner ticks about once a minute; a sub-minute cadence runs at most once
  a minute. Only issues with a `when` are ever fired.
- The `id` (filename stem) keys the scanner's "last fired" memory for scheduled
  issues, so don't rename a scheduled file you mean to keep (a new filename
  looks like a brand-new issue and fires right away).
- Runs are one-shot and independent — a run can overlap another run or your own
  interactive session in this same checkout. Treat it like ordinary concurrent
  edits; don't assume exclusive access.
- Each file is parsed and re-validated on every scan; a malformed file is
  reported on the board, in isolation, without breaking the other issues.
- Remove an issue by deleting its `.alice/issues/<id>.md` file (and commit). To
  pause a schedule without deleting it, set `status: done` or `status: canceled`.
- **Legacy:** the old single `.alice/issue.json` is retired. If you find one,
  split each issue into its own `.alice/issues/<id>.md` file with the
  frontmatter above.
