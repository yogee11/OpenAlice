# OpenAlice Owner Guides

This directory holds durable subsystem truth. `AGENTS.md` is the compact
startup index; detailed rules belong here and should be loaded only when the
task touches their scope.

Use wikilinks as stable agent-facing routes and ordinary Markdown links for
GitHub navigation.

| [[docs/connector-service.md]] | [Connector Service](connector-service.md) | Optional Discord/Telegram Inbox projection, adapters, secrets, health, Guardian lifecycle |
| [[docs/ui-interaction-and-motion.md]] | [UI interaction and motion](ui-interaction-and-motion.md) | Clickable affordances, shared motion tokens, entrances/disclosures, reduced-motion policy |
| [[docs/workspace-agent-guidance.md]] | [Workspace agent guidance](workspace-agent-guidance.md) | Always-loaded prompt contract, skill ownership, live CLI authority, guidance versioning |

| [[docs/conversation-provenance.md]] | [Workspace Session and artifact provenance](conversation-provenance.md) | `resumeId` identity, artifact trails, Issue execution responsibility, and provenance-before-collaboration sequencing |

Other files under `docs/images/` are README/product assets rather than owner
guides.

## Maintenance Rule

- Every owner guide states what it owns and points to the current load-bearing
  code paths.
- When code and a guide disagree, verify the runtime and update the guide in the
  same change.
- Do not copy an owner guide back into `AGENTS.md`; add or update its wikilink.
- Do not leave executable instructions in a retired guide. Keep a short
  tombstone when old external links need a destination.
- Prefer self-describing code/catalogs over copied provider, event, or route
  inventories that immediately drift.
