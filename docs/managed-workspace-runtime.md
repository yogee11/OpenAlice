# Managed Workspace Runtime

This guide owns the packaged-desktop runtime contract for Workspace agents.
Read it before changing desktop packaging, agent discovery, Pi launch behavior,
the Windows shell/toolchain, or the `OPENALICE_MANAGED_*` environment keys.

[[docs/development-workflow.md]].

## Product Contract

A packaged OpenAlice install must be able to open a Workspace on a fresh
supported machine without asking the user to install Node, npm, Git, Bash, or
an agent CLI first.

The default packaged path is:

1. OpenAlice supplies a managed Pi runtime.
2. The user configures an API-key credential in **Settings → AI Provider**.
3. OpenAlice injects that credential into the Workspace's Pi config.
4. Pi starts with the OpenAlice CLIs and shared skills already available.

The runtime and the model credential are separate requirements. Bundling Pi
removes the CLI/toolchain prerequisite; it does not bundle a model account or
API key. User-installed Claude Code, Codex, opencode, or Pi remain supported as
additional runtimes and may use their own subscription login or local config.

Source/dev and Docker installs are different deployment shapes. They do not
inherit the packaged desktop's managed-agent promise and may require an agent
CLI to be installed in the host environment or image.

## Current Platform Payloads

### macOS packaged app

The app ships:

- Electron's bundled Node runtime;
- the pinned managed Pi npm runtime under `vendor/pi/`;
- the existing packaged Git path used by Workspace bootstrap.

Pi uses `/bin/bash` when available and falls back to `/bin/sh`. The packaged
app can still discover user-installed CLIs from common Homebrew, pnpm, and
user-bin locations when it was launched from Finder with a minimal `PATH`.

### Windows packaged app

The app ships:

- Electron's bundled Node runtime;
- the same pinned managed Pi npm runtime;
- a pinned PortableGit payload under `vendor/git/<platform>-<arch>/`, including
  `git.exe`, `bash.exe`, `sh.exe`, and the command-line tools Pi needs.

OpenAlice launches managed Pi through Electron in Node mode and gives Pi the
managed Bash path. Workspace child processes receive the PortableGit command
directories on `PATH`, so the default packaged flow does not require Node,
npm, Git for Windows, WSL, or a system agent CLI.

Workspace-facing OpenAlice commands (`alice`, `alice-workspace`, `traderhub`,
and `alice-uta`) also do not depend on a host Node installation. Their POSIX
and Windows launchers execute the explicit `openalice-cli.cjs` payload through
the Electron executable recorded in `OPENALICE_MANAGED_PI_NODE_PATH`, with
`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`. Source/dev falls back to `node` from the contributor
environment. Keep the public commands as launchers: executing extensionless
JavaScript directly makes behavior depend on the host Node version and the
nearest `package.json` module type.

The Windows package currently retains dugite's embedded Git payload as well as
PortableGit. This duplication is intentional until all Workspace Git call
sites have moved behind an OpenAlice-owned wrapper.

## Packaging and Runtime Flow

### 1. Vendor pinned payloads

`scripts/vendor-managed-runtime.mjs` prepares the runtime before packaging. It:

- downloads Pi's pinned install package and lockfile;
- verifies their checksums;
- runs an isolated `npm ci --omit=dev` under `vendor/pi/`;
- downloads and verifies PortableGit on supported Windows targets;
- extracts it into the deterministic `vendor/git/<platform>-<arch>/` path;
- writes `vendor/manifest.json` with versions, paths, and toolchain entries.

`pnpm electron:pack` runs this through `pnpm vendor:runtime`. The desktop
builder keeps `asar` disabled and includes `vendor/**` in the packaged files.

### 2. Resolve packaged capabilities

`apps/desktop/src/main.ts` inspects the packaged resource tree before starting
Alice and injects the capabilities it actually finds:

```text
OPENALICE_RUNTIME_PROFILE=electron-packaged
OPENALICE_MANAGED_PI_PATH=/.../vendor/pi/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/dist/cli.js
OPENALICE_MANAGED_PI_NODE_PATH=/.../OpenAlice(.exe)
OPENALICE_MANAGED_GIT_DIR=/.../vendor/git/win32-x64
OPENALICE_MANAGED_GIT_BIN=/.../vendor/git/win32-x64/cmd/git.exe
OPENALICE_MANAGED_SHELL_PATH=/.../vendor/git/win32-x64/bin/bash.exe
OPENALICE_MANAGED_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/.../cmd:/.../bin:/.../usr/bin
LOCAL_GIT_DIRECTORY=/.../vendor/git/win32-x64
```

Paths are platform-specific and only appear when their payload exists. macOS
does not receive the Windows Git fields; packaged macOS does receive its
resolved system shell path.

### 3. Normalize the profile once

`src/core/runtime-profile.ts` parses those environment values into
`RuntimeProfile`. Workspace code consumes that profile rather than scattering
platform guesses across adapters.

The profile describes capabilities, not product permission. Managed Pi and a
managed shell do not grant trading access; trading mode and UTA enforcement
remain at the OpenAlice/UTA boundary.

### 4. Detect and launch agents

- `src/workspaces/agent-detect.ts` treats managed Pi as installed before
  falling back to a `pi` executable on `PATH`.
- `src/workspaces/spawn-env.ts` places OpenAlice's CLI shims first, followed by
  managed toolchain directories and host fallbacks. On Windows it also
  canonicalizes `Path`/`PATH` so Pi's nested shell keeps the injected entries.
- `src/workspaces/adapters/pi.ts` launches the npm runtime as
  `[managedPiNodePath, managedPiPath, ...args]` and writes the managed shell
  path into `.pi-agent/settings.json` when a Workspace credential override is
  present.

The managed npm runtime is not added to `PATH` as a fake `pi` binary; the Pi
adapter owns its explicit launch command. User-installed standalone Pi still
uses the normal `pi` command path.

Pi project trust follows the runtime boundary:

- interactive sessions never receive `--approve`; Pi shows its trust prompt
  and the user makes the project-resource decision;
- packaged headless sessions pass `--approve` because no user is present and
  OpenAlice controls the pinned managed Pi and Workspace contents;
- source/dev headless sessions do not receive version-specific approval flags.
  The Pi executable on `PATH`, its version, and its upgrade policy belong to
  the contributor running `pnpm dev`.

Do not add external-Pi version probing or upgrade UX to preserve flags used by
the packaged runtime. Compatibility for the packaged app is maintained by
pinning and upgrading the bundled Pi with the OpenAlice release.

## Workspace Bootstrap and Skills

Built-in templates run `bootstrap.mjs` on Electron's Node using
`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`. Their Git operations go through `_common.mjs` and
dugite; on packaged Windows, `LOCAL_GIT_DIRECTORY` points those calls at the
managed PortableGit directory.

Do not add new Bash bootstraps for built-in templates. `bootstrap.sh` remains
a compatibility fallback for third-party templates and only works where a
POSIX shell exists.

OpenAlice copies Workspace skills into two canonical project paths:

- `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code;
- `.agents/skills/` for Codex, current Pi, and compatible shared-skill readers.

Pi's provider state lives separately under `.pi-agent/`. Do not restore a
duplicate `.pi/skills/` copy: current Pi discovers the shared
`.agents/skills/` tree from the Workspace working directory.

## Packaging Invariants

Keep these true together:

- `vendor/**` remains in the Electron builder file list.
- `asar` remains disabled while packaged scripts and binaries are executed
  from the resource tree.
- `dugite` remains in `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` until its embedded payload
  is deliberately removed; skipping its postinstall silently produces an
  incomplete package.
- Pi and PortableGit versions, download URLs, and checksums remain pinned in
  `scripts/vendor-managed-runtime.mjs`.
- Every packaged Workspace CLI includes the shared `openalice-cli.cjs` payload,
  its POSIX launcher, and its Windows `.cmd` twin; packaged smoke must execute
  the payload through Electron Node.
- A runtime version bump updates its assertions and packaged smoke coverage in
  the same change.
- Windows keeps a single case-insensitive `PATH` entry after Workspace env
  construction.

## Verification

For runtime or packaging changes, run the focused local tests first:

```bash
pnpm vitest run \
  src/core/runtime-profile.spec.ts \
  src/workspaces/agent-detect.spec.ts \
  src/workspaces/spawn-env.spec.ts \
  src/workspaces/adapters/ai-config.spec.ts \
  scripts/vendor-managed-runtime.spec.ts \
  scripts/assert-desktop-package.spec.ts \
  scripts/smoke-packaged-toolchain.spec.ts
```

Then exercise the packaged path:

```bash
pnpm electron:build
pnpm vendor:runtime
pnpm -F @traderalice/desktop exec electron-builder --dir --projectDir ../.. --publish never
pnpm electron:assert-package
pnpm electron:smoke-toolchain
```

The `Desktop Package Smoke` workflow runs the macOS and Windows package
matrix. A release-facing change should also verify a clean-machine flow:

1. launch the packaged app with no system Node, Git, Bash, or Pi assumption;
2. add one compatible AI credential;
3. create a Chat Workspace using Pi;
4. run `alice --help`, edit a file, and inspect `git status`;
5. verify paths containing spaces and non-ASCII characters.

## Known Follow-up

PortableGit and dugite's embedded Git are still duplicated on Windows. The
next cleanup is to introduce an OpenAlice-owned Git execution wrapper, migrate
Workspace/template call sites to it, and remove dugite only after macOS and
Windows packaged smokes remain green.

That cleanup must not weaken the first-run contract: install OpenAlice,
configure a credential, open a Workspace, and let Alice work.
