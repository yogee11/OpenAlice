# Managed Workspace Runtime

This note captures the target design for making packaged OpenAlice usable on a
fresh machine without asking the user to install coding-agent command line
tools first.

The core product rule is simple: a desktop app distribution should not open
with "please install Node/npm/git/bash/pi". The packaged app should provide the
minimum managed runtime needed for a Workspace agent to start, edit files, run
commands, use Git, and call OpenAlice's injected `alice*` tools.

## Current Topology

OpenAlice is already much closer to this than a normal web app:

- Electron main is a Node-capable supervisor, not just a renderer shell.
- In packaged app mode, Electron starts Alice and UTA with:
  - `process.execPath`
  - `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
- `OPENALICE_APP_HOME` points at the unpacked app resources
  (`Contents/Resources/app` on macOS, equivalent resources dir on Windows).
- `asar` is disabled, so shipped scripts and vendor binaries can be executed
  from the app resource tree.
- Built-in workspace templates are plain `.mjs` scripts and run on the
  Electron-bundled Node with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`.
- Workspace bootstrap Git calls currently go through `dugite`.
- Agent tools are injected through PATH:
  - `src/workspaces/cli/bin` provides `alice`, `alice-uta`,
    `alice-workspace`, and `traderhub`.
  - Native coding agents reach OpenAlice by shelling out to these CLIs.

This means we do not need user-installed Node. Electron already gives us the
Node runtime for the backend and workspace bootstrap.

## Goals

- Packaged OpenAlice should include a managed Pi npm runtime on macOS and
  Windows.
- Windows packaged OpenAlice should include exactly one managed Git+shell
  runtime. Do not ship two Git trees.
- The managed runtime must be discovered through explicit capability/profile
  injection, not scattered `process.platform` guesses.
- Existing Workspace semantics stay intact: Pi is a coding runtime, not a
  trading-permission gate.
- UTA/trading permissions remain enforced at the OpenAlice/UTA tool boundary.
- User-installed CLIs may still be used as overrides or fallbacks, but are not
  required for the default packaged path.

## Non-Goals

- Do not make Pi responsible for account/trading safety.
- Do not introduce a second Windows Git runtime beside the existing packaged
  Git story.
- Do not require WSL, Git for Windows, Node, npm, pnpm, or system Git as a
  first-run prerequisite.
- Do not rewrite every Git call in the first implementation if a smaller step
  can keep the release path stable.

## Platform Strategy

### macOS

Ship:

- Electron Node (already present)
- managed Pi npm runtime (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`)
- existing managed Git path for workspace bootstrap and Git UI

Use:

- system `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh` as the Pi shell path

Rationale:

- macOS already has a usable shell.
- The missing first-run piece is Pi itself, not Bash.
- Bundling Pi as a pinned npm runtime keeps the desktop app promise without
  introducing another native runtime family. Electron already gives us Node.

### Windows

Ship:

- Electron Node (already present)
- managed Pi npm runtime (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`)
- one managed Git for Windows / MinGit style runtime that includes:
  - `git.exe`
  - `bash.exe`
  - `sh.exe`
  - required MSYS runtime DLLs
  - coreutils needed by normal agent shell commands

Use:

- managed `bash.exe` as Pi's `shellPath`
- the same managed Git runtime for workspace bootstrap, Git UI, and agent shell
  commands

Rationale:

- Pi's npm package does not provide a shell. OpenAlice must provide one.
- The existing dugite Windows native payload contains Git and POSIX-ish tools,
  but not a reliable full Bash story.
- Shipping both dugite's embedded Git and another Git for Windows tree would be
  wasteful and hard to reason about.

## Runtime Profile

Electron main should compute a normalized runtime profile and inject it into
Alice/UTA child process env. Alice-side modules should consume this profile
instead of re-discovering the runtime independently.

Suggested env keys:

```text
OPENALICE_RUNTIME_PROFILE=electron-packaged
OPENALICE_MANAGED_PI_PATH=/.../vendor/pi/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/dist/cli.js
OPENALICE_MANAGED_PI_NODE_PATH=/.../OpenAlice(.exe)
OPENALICE_MANAGED_GIT_DIR=/.../vendor/git
OPENALICE_MANAGED_GIT_BIN=/.../vendor/git/.../git(.exe)
OPENALICE_MANAGED_SHELL_PATH=/.../vendor/git/.../bash(.exe)
OPENALICE_MANAGED_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/.../vendor/git/.../bin:/.../vendor/git/.../usr/bin
```

In dev, these may be absent. In packaged app mode, they should be explicit
when the corresponding managed capability exists.

Alice should parse these centrally, likely in:

```text
src/core/runtime-profile.ts
```

Shape:

```ts
export interface RuntimeProfile {
  readonly launcher: 'dev' | 'electron-dev' | 'electron-packaged' | 'docker';
  readonly platform: NodeJS.Platform;
  readonly arch: NodeJS.Architecture;
  readonly appHome: string;
  readonly userDataHome: string;
  readonly nodeExecPath: string;
  readonly managedPiPath: string | null;
  readonly managedPiNodePath: string | null;
  readonly managedGitDir: string | null;
  readonly managedGitBin: string | null;
  readonly managedShellPath: string | null;
  readonly managedToolchainPath: readonly string[];
}
```

The profile should expose capabilities, not policy. Policy belongs in the
workspace launcher and adapters.

## Resolution Rules

### Agent Availability

For `/agents`, `pi` availability should resolve in this order:

1. `OPENALICE_MANAGED_PI_PATH` exists and is executable.
2. PATH contains `pi` / `pi.exe`.
3. Not installed.

The response should eventually distinguish source:

```ts
type AgentRuntimeSource = 'managed' | 'path' | 'missing';
```

The first implementation can keep the old boolean `installed` contract while
internally preferring the managed path.

### Pi Spawn Command

The Pi adapter should prefer the managed path without changing Workspace's
runtime model.

Current commands are shaped like:

```ts
['pi', '--session-id', id]
['pi', '-p', '--mode', 'json', prompt]
```

Managed npm mode should become:

```ts
[managedPiNodePath, managedPiPath, '--session-id', id]
[managedPiNodePath, managedPiPath, '-p', '--mode', 'json', prompt]
```

If a future standalone Pi binary is used instead, omit
`OPENALICE_MANAGED_PI_NODE_PATH` and spawn `[managedPiPath, ...]`.

On Windows, this avoids npm shim behavior and the `cmd.exe` wrapper path used
for `.cmd` files. The interactive and headless paths both spawn Electron in
Node mode directly.

### Spawn PATH

Workspace spawn env should prepend:

1. OpenAlice CLI shim dir: `src/workspaces/cli/bin`
2. managed Pi binary dir, if using a standalone binary
3. managed Git/shell bin dirs, if present
4. existing user/system PATH fallbacks

This belongs in `src/workspaces/spawn-env.ts` and should be driven by
`RuntimeProfile`. For the npm runtime, do not add Pi's `dist/` directory to
PATH; the adapter launches `cli.js` explicitly through Electron Node.

### Pi Shell Path

Pi reads `settings.json` from the Pi agent dir. OpenAlice already redirects
Pi's agent dir to per-workspace `.pi-agent` when a workspace provider override
exists.

When a managed shell exists, Pi config written by OpenAlice should include:

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "workspace",
  "defaultModel": "...",
  "shellPath": "/absolute/path/to/bash-or-system-shell"
}
```

Rules:

- Windows packaged: use managed `bash.exe`.
- macOS packaged: use `/bin/bash` if it exists, else `/bin/sh`.
- Dev: do not force a shell path unless explicitly provided.

Important: this is not a permission boundary. It is runtime plumbing so Pi's
`bash` tool has a shell to execute.

## Git Strategy

There are two separate concerns:

1. Git executable/runtime payload
2. JS API used by Alice code and bootstrap scripts

### Phase 1: Replace Windows Git Payload, Keep Dugite API

Keep `dugite.exec()` call sites initially:

- `src/workspaces/workspace-creator.ts`
- `src/workspaces/git-service.ts`
- `src/workspaces/templates/_common.mjs`

But on Windows packaged builds:

- ship the managed Git for Windows runtime as `vendor/git/...`
- exclude or avoid packaging dugite's own `node_modules/dugite/git/**`
- set `LOCAL_GIT_DIRECTORY` to the managed Git dir before Alice starts

Dugite supports `LOCAL_GIT_DIRECTORY`; with that env set, existing
`dugite.exec()` calls should resolve Git from the managed runtime instead of
dugite's embedded payload.

This gets us one Windows Git runtime while preserving the established API and
test surface.

### Phase 2: OpenAlice Git Wrapper

After Phase 1 is stable, introduce an OpenAlice-owned wrapper, for example:

```text
src/workspaces/git-runtime.ts
```

and a bootstrap-compatible JS helper for templates.

Then migrate call sites from `dugite.exec()` to `gitExec()` and consider
removing `dugite` entirely.

Do not combine this with Phase 1 unless necessary. Workspace creation is core
infrastructure; make the payload swap independently testable.

## Packaging Layout

Suggested packaged resource layout:

```text
app/
  dist/
  ui/dist/
  src/workspaces/cli/bin/
  src/workspaces/templates/
  services/uta/dist/
  vendor/
    pi/
      package.json
      package-lock.json
      node_modules/
        @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/
          dist/cli.js
    git/
      win32-x64/
        cmd/git.exe
        bin/bash.exe
        usr/bin/...
      win32-arm64/
        ...
```

The runtime preparation should be scripted, pinned by version and checksum,
and run before `electron-builder`.

Script:

```text
scripts/vendor-managed-runtime.mjs
```

Responsibilities:

- download pinned Pi install package + lockfile from the Pi release
- verify checksums
- run an isolated `npm ci --omit=dev` under `vendor/pi`
- emit a machine-readable manifest

Later responsibilities:

- download pinned Git for Windows / MinGit runtime for Windows
- verify checksums
- unpack into a deterministic vendor directory
- prune docs/examples only if license obligations remain satisfied
- extend the machine-readable manifest:

```json
{
  "pi": {
    "version": "0.80.3",
    "mode": "npm",
    "cli": "vendor/pi/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/dist/cli.js"
  },
  "git": {
    "win32-x64": {
      "path": "vendor/git/win32-x64",
      "gitBin": "cmd/git.exe",
      "shellPath": "bin/bash.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

## Electron Main Injection

`apps/desktop/src/main.ts` already computes `homeEnv`.

Add managed runtime resolution nearby, before spawning Alice/UTA:

```ts
const runtimeEnv = resolveManagedRuntimeEnv({
  appHome: homeEnv.OPENALICE_APP_HOME,
  platform: process.platform,
  arch: process.arch,
});
```

Then merge into children:

```ts
env: {
  ...process.env,
  ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE: '1',
  ...homeEnv,
  ...runtimeEnv,
}
```

This must happen for Alice. UTA does not need Pi, but inheriting harmless
profile values is acceptable if it keeps the launcher simple.

## Code-Level Touch Points

Expected first implementation files:

- `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`
  - resolve managed runtime paths
  - inject runtime profile env
- `src/core/runtime-profile.ts`
  - parse env once
  - expose capability paths
- `src/workspaces/agent-detect.ts`
  - detect managed Pi before PATH Pi
- `src/workspaces/spawn-env.ts`
  - prepend managed Pi/toolchain paths
- `src/workspaces/adapters/pi.ts`
  - use managed Pi npm CLI path in commands
  - write `shellPath` into `.pi-agent/settings.json` when available
- `src/workspaces/service.ts`
  - thread runtime profile into adapter context if needed
- `package.json`
  - include `vendor/**` in `build.files`
  - add vendoring script to packaging flow
- `scripts/vendor-managed-runtime.mjs`
  - prepare pinned Pi npm runtime
- `scripts/desktop-packaged-smoke.mjs`
  - assert packaged profile and managed Pi availability

Potential later files:

- `src/workspaces/git-runtime.ts`
- `src/workspaces/templates/_common.mjs`
- `src/workspaces/git-service.ts`
- `src/workspaces/workspace-creator.ts`

## Tests

Unit tests:

- runtime profile parser:
  - no managed env in dev
  - packaged paths parse correctly
  - missing files are reported predictably
- agent detection:
  - managed Pi wins over PATH
  - PATH Pi works when managed Pi is absent
  - missing Pi reports missing
- spawn env:
  - OpenAlice CLI shim is first
  - standalone managed Pi dir and managed toolchain dirs are prepended
  - npm managed Pi does not add its `dist/` directory to PATH
  - existing PATH remains available
- Pi adapter:
  - command uses `[Electron Node, cli.js]` when npm managed Pi is provided
  - command uses managed binary path when standalone managed Pi is provided
  - `settings.json` includes `shellPath` only when profile provides it
  - reset behavior does not leave stale provider secrets

Packaged smoke tests:

- `pnpm electron:smoke:packaged --temp-data`
- verify `/agents` reports Pi installed from managed runtime
- create chat workspace
- spawn Pi session
- run:

```bash
alice --help
git --version
pwd
```

`pi --version` is not required to resolve as a shell command in npm managed
mode; the launcher starts Pi through `[Electron Node, cli.js]`.

Windows acceptance smoke:

- clean Windows VM with no Node, no npm, no Git for Windows, no WSL
- install OpenAlice
- open app
- configure one AI credential
- start Pi workspace
- ask Pi to run `alice --help`
- ask Pi to edit a file and run `git status`
- verify workspace creation works with PATH stripped
- verify paths with spaces and non-ASCII characters

## Rollout Plan

### Step 1: Design and Runtime Profile

- Add `RuntimeProfile` parser.
- Inject profile env from Electron main.
- No packaging behavior change yet.

### Step 2: Managed Pi on macOS

- Vendor Pi npm runtime.
- Add managed Pi detection and spawn.
- Packaged smoke on macOS.

### Step 3: Managed Pi on Windows

- Vendor Pi npm runtime.
- Prefer explicit `[Electron Node, cli.js]`.
- Confirm Pi starts in packaged app.

### Step 4: Windows Managed Git+Shell Runtime

- Vendor one Windows Git+Shell runtime.
- Set `LOCAL_GIT_DIRECTORY`.
- Set managed `shellPath` to `bash.exe`.
- Exclude or avoid packaging dugite's embedded Windows Git payload.
- Confirm there is only one Git runtime in the Windows installer.

### Step 5: Optional Dugite API Removal

- Introduce OpenAlice `gitExec()`.
- Migrate code and template helper.
- Remove `dugite` only after packaged Windows/macOS smoke stays green.

## Open Questions

- Which Git for Windows / MinGit artifact should be pinned for Windows?
- Can `LOCAL_GIT_DIRECTORY` fully cover every existing dugite call in packaged
  Windows, or do any call sites depend on dugite-specific env setup?
- Should managed Pi be updated only with app releases, or should OpenAlice
  support runtime updates independently later?
- How aggressively can we prune Pi docs/examples/assets while staying license
  compliant and preserving useful local help?
- Should `/agents` expose runtime source (`managed` vs `path`) immediately, or
  keep it internal for the first slice?

## Product Principle

OpenAlice can still support external CLIs for power users, but the packaged app
must have a coherent first-run path:

1. user installs OpenAlice
2. user configures AI credential
3. user opens Workspace
4. Alice can work

No Node/npm/Git/Bash/Pi prerequisite should appear before that loop.
