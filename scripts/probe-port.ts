 *
 * Used by `scripts/guardian/` (the dev-mode L2 port authority) to pick the
 * backend's web / MCP / UTA ports before spawning. Intentionally duplicated
 * from `electron/probe-port.ts` — dev script tooling and packaged
 * Electron runtime are different release surfaces, sharing through src/
 * would require breaking the electron tsconfig rootDir boundary.
 *
 * Keep the two copies in sync if you ever fix a bug here.
