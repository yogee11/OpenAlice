/**
 * Shared header → {@link InboxOrigin} resolver for the two workspace-scoped
 * route mounts (`/mcp/:wsId` and `/cli/:wsId/:export/invoke`).
 *
 * Both routes read the SAME out-of-band headers and resolve them the SAME way,
 * so the resolution lives here once — they can't drift. There are two carriers,
 * mutually exclusive per spawn:
 *
 *   - `x-openalice-run`     — HEADLESS run identity. Injected as `AQ_RUN_ID`
 *                             (the run's taskId) into the headless spawn env;
 *                             resolved against the {@link HeadlessTaskRegistry}.
 *   - `x-openalice-session` — INTERACTIVE session identity. Injected as
 *                             `AQ_SESSION_ID` (the pre-allocated SessionRegistry
 *                             record id) into the interactive PTY spawn env;
 *                             resolved against the SessionRegistry, scoped by the
 *                             route's wsId.
 *
 * Both are forwarded by OpenAlice-owned transport (the `alice` CLI shim / a
 * native-MCP static header) and NEVER supplied by the agent in a tool call — the
 * agent never traffics its own identity (symmetric for both kinds).
 *
 * Authority is the registry, not the request: we look the id up and read the
 * provenance off the STORED record. A header that doesn't match a known record
 * resolves to `undefined` (no origin) — so a forged or stale value can't
 * fabricate a link, for either kind.
 *
 * Precedence: a resolvable run header wins (headless is the authoritative
 * automation path); only when there's no headless run do we consider the
 * session header.
