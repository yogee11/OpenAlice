/**
 * Bridge from Alice's central credential store to a workspace's per-CLI AI
 * config.
 *
 * The central store (`aiProviderSchema.credentials` in `core/config.ts`) holds
 * the vendor-neutral secret: `{ vendor, authType, apiKey?, baseUrl? }`. Each CLI
 * adapter instead consumes a `WorkspaceAiCred` (`cli-adapter.ts`) and renders it
 * into its own file format. A credential carries no model — model is always a
 * per-use choice — so the caller supplies it (plus the adapter-specific
 * `authMode` / `wireApi` knobs) via `overrides`. The vault's `lastModel` is a
 * remembered default, not a lock; callers may still supply a per-use model.
 *
 * This is the one place that maps Credential → WorkspaceAiCred, used by
 * template-driven injection at workspace-create time and reusable by any future
 * "apply credential to workspace" path.
