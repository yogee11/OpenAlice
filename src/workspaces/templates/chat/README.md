# Chat

A general-purpose Alice workspace. The agent boots with Alice's full tool
surface — market/research data plus trading, through the `alice*` / `traderhub`
CLIs on its PATH — and Alice's persona pre-loaded as CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md.

## What this workspace does

This is the closest equivalent to "talk to Alice about anything
trading-related," but it is still a workspace, not a stateless chat room. The
agent can quote tickers, pull boards and fundamentals, search the collected-RSS
archive, run indicators, write research files, track entities with `[[name]]`,
and turn follow-up into `.alice/issues/<id>.md` work items. The bundled
`opencli-reader` skill additionally teaches it to reach long-tail sources
(social sentiment, options flow, global news frontpages) through the optional
community `opencli` CLI — it will ask before assuming you have it.

When an Inbox result or Issue is hard to interpret, the workspace can ask its
attributable product Session directly. It can also dispatch several peer
questions concurrently, await them server-side, and synthesize the replies
without hand-written sleep loops or leaking runtime-native session ids.

Trading runs through the `alice-uta` CLI against your UTA accounts — orders go
through the trading-as-git approval flow. Recurring/headless work runs through
scheduled issues: add a `when` field to an issue and the launcher fires it as a
headless workspace run.

## When to spawn this

- You want a long-running thread with Alice that isn't tied to a specific research artifact or autoresearch loop.
- You're exploring an idea and don't yet know which workspace the job needs — Chat is the no-commitment starting point.
- You want quick access to Alice's full data surface without setting up Auto-Quant clones or finance-skill trees.
- You want to turn a loose market concern into a durable issue, tracked entity, Inbox report, or scheduled check.

## What you'll see in Inbox

Inbox keeps durable report delivery separate from the live terminal. A user or
peer agent can ask the attributable sender about a report; when only the
Workspace is known, OpenAlice creates a fresh reconstruction Session and labels
it honestly instead of pretending it found the original author.

Things Alice will route here:
- Research notes, thesis updates, and market snapshots worth re-reading later.
- Reports produced by scheduled issues or headless runs.
- Trade execution summaries or staged-operation notes when trading work happens.

## Parameters

When spawning, you'll configure:
- **Tag** — short identifier for this workspace (lowercase, dashes ok).

All available CLI runtimes (Claude, Codex, opencode, Pi, shell) are enabled by default; the template's first listed adapter is what the `+` "new session" button defaults to.
