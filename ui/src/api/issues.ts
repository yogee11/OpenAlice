 * Issue board — the canonical client shape for GET /api/issues.
 *
 * Each workspace owns its issues as one markdown file per issue
 * (`.alice/issues/<id>.md`); the board scans every workspace (like
 * /api/schedule does for the scheduling projection) — there is NO central
 * store. An issue WITH a `when` is scheduled (the scanner fires it as a
 * headless run); an issue WITHOUT `when` is a pure tracked work item.
 *
 * Phase 1 is read-only and the list does NOT carry the markdown body — the
 * Phase 2 detail view loads that on demand.
 *
 * Demo handlers MUST import these types (do not inline an ad-hoc shape):
 * demo-shape drift has crashed the app before.
